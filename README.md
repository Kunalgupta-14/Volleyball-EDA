# Volleyball EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of volleyball player statistics during matches. The dataset includes various performance metrics for each player, categorized by their position on the court.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains multiple features representing the performance of volleyball players during matches. Each player’s position and their corresponding statistics are included.

### Positions
- **OH (Outside Hitter)**: A player responsible for attacking, blocking, and receiving serves from the opponent.
- **OP (Opposite Hitter)**: A player positioned opposite the setter, with a similar role to the outside hitter but often playing in the back row as well.
- **MB (Middle Blocker)**: A player who focuses on blocking the opposing team's attacks and plays near the net.
- **S (Setter)**: A player who sets the ball for attackers, often coordinating the offense of the team.
- **L (Libero)**: A player who specializes in receiving serves and playing in the back row for defensive purposes.

### Features
Each player has various performance metrics associated with their position:

- **Attack**: A player's overall average performance in offensive actions during each game. This includes points scored and errors made during attacks.
  
- **Block**: A player's performance in defense, specifically blocking the opposing team's attacks. It includes direct points, errors, and touching the ball without changing the outcome of the rally.
  
- **Defense**: A player's overall defense on the net, which involves blocking, error rates, and other defensive actions like touching the ball without scoring or changing the rally outcome.
  
- **Serve**: Represents a player's service performance during the match. Except for the libero, all players serve during each turn to start the game, and this feature shows their service accuracy and effectiveness.
  
- **Set**: Represents the setter’s ability to set the ball, including successful sets, errors, and the total number of set attempts. In certain situations, players from other positions also participate in setting.
  
- **Dig**: The average of digs (defensive actions to keep the ball in play), errors made, and receptions performed by the player.
  
- **Receive**: The average of successful receptions, errors, and reception attempts per match. This is particularly important for players like liberos and outside hitters who frequently handle the ball.
